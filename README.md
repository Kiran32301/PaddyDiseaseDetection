This research addresses the significant challenges of pests and diseases in paddy
production, causing a global loss of approximately 20% in rice yield. The focus is on early
identification of rice leaf diseases using thermal image cameras to mitigate losses. The study
introduces a Modified Lemurs Optimization Algorithm as a feature selection method to
enhance the accuracy of paddy disease detection using techniques of machine learning.
Inspired by Sine Cosine Optimization, the Modified Lemurs Optimization Algorithm is
applied to thermal images of paddy leaves, considering five diseases namely rice blast, brown
leaf spot, leaf folder, hispa, and bacterial leaf blight are considered in our work. Six hundred
thirty-six thermal images are analyzed, extracting statistical and Box-Cox transformed features.
Four machine learning techniques are tested namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random
Forest Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifiers and
their performance is enhanced by the proposed feature transform, with KNN achieving a
balanced accuracy of 90%.
